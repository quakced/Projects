                        told this by many of my peers. I hope to get into the field of Computer Sciece, Computer Engineering, or Animation and VFX. I have always been intresed in technology since I
                        was young. My mom works in IT so I learned a thing or two through my years. Now that Technology and AI are advancing everyday I have found that getting into a career in 
                        Technology will be benifical for me.
